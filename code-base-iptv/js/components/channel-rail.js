/**
 * Horizontal channel rail, shared by the home stage and the player overlay.
 *
 * A provider playlist can carry several thousand entries, and building that
 * many tiles up front costs the TV both the DOM work and one image request
 * per tile (`loading="lazy"` is ignored by the webOS browser, so every logo
 * would be fetched immediately) — which is what made moving the cursor feel
 * sluggish. The rail therefore renders a moving window of the list and grows
 * it in both directions as the cursor approaches either end, so the whole
 * playlist stays reachable without ever existing in the DOM at once.
 *
 * The window bounds live on the container element itself rather than in
 * module state, so the two rails (stage and player) can be open at once
 * without sharing a cursor.
